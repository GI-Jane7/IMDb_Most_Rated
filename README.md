# IMDb_Most_Rated
A webscraping Project to Extract and load data into a CSV file format.

Website Scraped: [IMDb](https://m.imdb.com/chart/top/). IMDb is the world's most popular and authoritative source for movie, TV and celebrity content. You can find ratings and reviews for the newest movie and TV shows.

After Scraping the website and extracting the necessary information i needed, I loaded it into a csv file.

This Project helped me up ETL skill.
